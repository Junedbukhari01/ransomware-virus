# ransomware-virus
Hey Geeks,  My PC got attacked by a ransomware virus which encrypted all my files with the extension “.moqs” . I’m not able to decrypt it, I tried many softwares but none worked. Any advice or help on how to restore my data? It’s urgent.  (Share this to your Tech Buddies) Thanks in advance 🙏🏻
